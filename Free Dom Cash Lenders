Insurance premiums provide an important source of revenue for lenders. Premiums are calculated on the total payments on the loan, including not only the proceeds but also the share of each payment covering other premiums, fees, and interest.50 As previously noted, premiums are charged when a loan is issued, then added to the principal and financed, triggering more interest and in some cases larger origination fees and longer loan durations, which increase borrowers’ costs and boost lenders’ revenue.51

For example, a contract from North Carolina for $2,173 in loan proceeds had monthly payments of $150. Without the addition of insurance, those payments would have paid off the loan in 18.5 months. However, because of the premiums the loan lasted 30 months and the cost quadrupled, from $592 to $2,327, exceeding the loan proceeds.
