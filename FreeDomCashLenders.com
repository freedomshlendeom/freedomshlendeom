In dollar terms, added credit insurance and other ancillary products increased the cost of borrowing in states that allow them by more than a third on average. (See Table 2.) These findings are consistent with previous research, which estimated that credit insurance increased the cost of borrowing by over 35 percent on average.45

This analysis also found that in states with higher interest rate caps but bans on ancillary products, loans tend to cost borrowers less than in states that have caps of 36 percent or less but allow the sale of insurance and other products.46 (See Figure 8.) These findings indicate that when states set rate limits under which consumer finance companies cannot make loans profitably, lenders sell credit insurance to earn revenue that they are not permitted to generate through interest or fees. Setting artificially low interest rate limits while allowing the sale of credit insurance raises costs for consumers while obscuring the scale of those increases.
